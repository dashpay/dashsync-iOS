/**
Responsible for handling Core Data model migrations.

The default Core Data model migration approach is to go from earlier version to all possible future versions.

So, if we have 4 model versions (1, 2, 3, 4), you would need to create the following mappings 1 to 4, 2 to 4 and 3 to 4.
Then when we create model version 5, we would create mappings 1 to 5, 2 to 5, 3 to 5 and 4 to 5. You can see that for each
new version we must create new mappings from all previous versions to the current version. This does not scale well, in the
above example 4 new mappings have been created. For each new version you must add n-1 new mappings.

Instead the solution below uses an iterative approach where we migrate mutliple times through a chain of model versions.

So, if we have 4 model versions (1, 2, 3, 4), you would need to create the following mappings 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and 3 to 4.
Then when we create model version 5, we only need to create one additional mapping 4 to 5. This greatly reduces the work
required when adding a new version.
